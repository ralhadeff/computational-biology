This MC program simulates a reduced model of a transporter, with discreet sites and a fixed number of ions.

see https://www.pnas.org/content/112/40/12378 for implementation and first publication using this program.

Disclaimer - written in Perl, this program is not particularly fast. For faster results, using FORTRAN or C is advised.

example input files are given for the Na/H antiporer and for the ZnT2 transporter
