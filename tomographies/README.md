work in progress

the goal is to learn what cell slices look like and generate de-novo images of cell slices.

chronological order of attempts:
`simple_AE-ul` - Autoencoder and generation from noise. Reconstruction seems good, but the image from noise gives the same averaged image.
`vae_small` - VAE with no convolution, on a subset of the data
`manual_ae` - 
`image_process` - more attention has been given to process the input images, removing noise and normalizing the intensity
