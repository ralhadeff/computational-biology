Programs and tools written for my PhD and post-doc computational biology research projects (protein functional modeling and characterization).

These programs and tools were written and developed during my PhD at the Hebrew University (Prof. Shy Arkin group) and during my post-doctoral fellowship at the University of Southern California (Nobel laureate Prof. Arieh Warshel group).

The projects deal with analyzing, characterizing and modeling the function of proteins, mostly transporters.

Tools include scripts for manipulating `pdb`s and outputs; and software to run Monte Carlo simulations (using the Metropolis acceptance criterion) and Brownian Dynamics (*aka* Langevin Dynamics).

Software used to generate some of the outputs are Gromacs (http://www.gromacs.org/) and Molaris (https://laetro.usc.edu/software.html).
