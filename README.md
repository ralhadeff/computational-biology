# computational-biology
Programs and tools written for my PhD and post-doc computational biology projects (protein functional modeling and characterization).

These programs and tools were written and developed during my PhD at the Hebrew University or during my post-doctoral fellowship at the University of Southern California.

The projects deal with analyzing, characterizing and modeling the function of proteins, mostly transporters.

Tools include scripts for manipulating pdbs and outputs and software to run Monte Carlo simulations (using Metropolis criterion) and Brownian Dynamics (aka Langevin Dynamics).

Software used to generate some of the outputs are Gromacs (http://www.gromacs.org/) and Molaris (https://laetro.usc.edu/software.html).
